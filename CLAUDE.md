# Nail — project guide for Claude

Nail (working name) is an email + PIM client: Rust core, TypeScript/React UI, Tauri 2 desktop shell, a web-server mode that serves the same UI, and MCP access to all data.

- What to build: `docs/design.md` (exported from the living doc linked in its header).
- How and in which order: `docs/plan.md` (milestones M0–M4, work packages, gates).
- Decisions and deviations: `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`.
- Project memory: `.claude/memory/` (see "Memory" below).

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Tests from day 1.** Every change ships with unit tests; every user-visible behaviour with a Playwright scenario. Never report work as done while any suite is red or tests were skipped.
- **Docs split.** Internal docs → `docs/`. User-facing manuals and references → `userDocs/<lang>/` (`en` written, `de` empty for now).
- **Languages.** No literal user-visible strings in React or Rust. Strings live in Fluent catalogs `locales/en/*.ftl` (complete) and `locales/de/*.ftl` (same files, empty). Missing keys fall back to English per key.
- **Everything themeable.** React components never use inline styles or literal class names. They emit `data-part` attributes; styling comes only from the compiled theme (`theme.kdl`). Structure comes only from `layout.kdl`.
- **The core owns data.** The UI talks only to `NailClient`; business logic lives in Rust. Every write goes through the operation queue.
- **Windows first.** macOS, Linux and mobile come later.
- **Record decisions.** New library choices or deviations from the design get an ADR.
- **Keep this file current.** When commands, layout or conventions change, update this file in the same commit.

## Tooling facts

- Rust 1.97 (MSVC), Node 26 + npm 11. **npm workspaces, not pnpm** (pnpm is not installed). No docker locally: integration tests use in-process mock servers from `crates/nail-testkit`.
- The repo lives in OneDrive. Build output must stay outside it: a local, gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` sets `target-dir` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nail-build\target`. When running several cargo processes in parallel, give each its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.
- Config files are KDL v2.

## Layout

```
crates/nail-api        shared types + Request/Response/Event protocol (ts-rs → ui/src/api/generated)
crates/nail-config     theme.kdl / layout.kdl parsing, defaults, schema, watcher
crates/nail-store      SQLite metadata, blob store, operation queue
crates/nail-mime       MIME parsing, HTML sanitizing
crates/nail-proto-imap IMAP client
crates/nail-testkit    mock servers, .eml corpus, demo seed
crates/nail-core       Service: routes requests, owns store/config/sync
crates/nail-server     axum: UI bundle, WebSocket API, blobs
crates/nail-cli        `nail` binary
app/src-tauri          Tauri 2 desktop shell
ui/                    React renderer
e2e/                   Playwright tests
defaults/              shipped theme.kdl + layout.kdl
locales/               Fluent catalogs (en, de)
```

## Commands

(Filled in as milestone M0 lands; keep in sync with `docs/dev-setup.md`.)

```
npm install / npm ci                       # npm workspaces: ui, e2e
npm run build                              # ui/dist — required before any `cargo … --workspace` (Tauri embeds it)
cargo test                                 # default members = all crates except app/src-tauri
cargo test --workspace                     # incl. the Tauri shell (after npm run build)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
npm test                                   # Vitest (ui), incl. the lint-rule self-test
npm run lint                               # ESLint + tsc + Prettier (ui), tsc + Prettier (e2e)
npm run gen:api                            # regenerate ui/src/api/generated from nail-api (a test fails when stale)
npm run e2e                                # Playwright (placeholder spec skipped until WP6)
```

- The contract lives in `crates/nail-api`; its fixtures `fixtures/default-{theme,layout}.json` describe the default UI. See ADRs 0002 (protocol) and 0003 (config models, part/DOM conventions).

## Git

- Branch `main`. Commit only when asked, or as part of an agreed workflow stage.
- End commit messages with the Co-Authored-By / Claude-Session lines required by the session.

## Memory

Project memory lives in the repo at `.claude/memory/` (one fact per file, index in `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`). Don't store project memory anywhere else. Update or delete entries that turn out to be wrong.
